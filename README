This is FreeWPC, an open source operating system for the Williams
Pinball Controller (WPC) family of pinball machines.  FreeWPC is
licensed under the GNU General Public License, Version 2.

To quickly get started, install vagrant from vagrantup.com,
clone this repository, and run the command 'vagrant up' from within
the freewpc directory. Within 30 minutes you'll have a fully configured
linux build environment!

The sources for the core routines are located in 'kernel';
other common code is in 'common', and game-specific code can be found 
in a subdirectory based on the machine name, under 'machine'.
There are also a number of tools included with the distribution
for generating some of the source code and for building ROM images
that are under 'tools'.

You will also need several tools not here in order to build.
See the file doc/build.html for more detailed information.  Most
importantly, you'll need a copy of the gcc6809 cross-compiler.
Many standard UNIX utilities are needed as well.  FreeWPC has been
built successfully on Linux and Cygwin.
